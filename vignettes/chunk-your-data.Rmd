  How to resolve memory issues

Users of the [r2dii.match](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/) package reported that their R session crashed when they fed `match_name()` with big data. A [recent post](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-07-18-improving-r2dii-match/) acknowledged the issue and promised examples on how to handle big data. This article shows one approach: feed [`match_name()`](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/reference/match_name.html) with a sequence of small chunks of the `loanbook` dataset.

## Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE
)
```

This example uses r2dii.match plus a few optional but convenient packages, including [r2dii.data](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.data/) for example datasets.

```{r}
# Packages
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(fs)
library(vroom)
library(r2dii.data)
library(r2dii.match)

# Example datasets from the r2dii.data package
loanbook <- loanbook_demo
abcd <- abcd_demo
```

If the entire `loanbook` is too large, feed `match_name()` with smaller chunks, so that any call to `match_name(this_chunk, abcd)` fits in memory. More chunks take longer to run but use less memory; you'll need to experiment to find the number of chunks that best works for you. 

Say you try three chunks. You can take the `loanbook` dataset and then use `mutate()` to add the new column `chunk`, which assigns each row to one of the `chunks`:

```{r}
chunks <- 3
chunked <- loanbook %>% mutate(chunk = as.integer(cut(row_number(), chunks)))
```

The total number of rows in the entire `loanbook` equals the sum of the rows across chunks.

```{r}
count(loanbook)

count(chunked, chunk)
```

For each chunk you need to repeat this process:

1. Match this chunk against the entire `abcd` dataset.
2. If this chunk matched nothing, move to the next chunk.
3. Else, save the result to a .csv file.

```{r}
# This "output" directory is temporary; you may use any folder in your computer
out <- path(tempdir(), "output")
if (!dir_exists(out)) dir_create(out)

for (i in unique(chunked$chunk)) {
  # 1. Match this chunk against the entire `abcd` dataset.
  this_chunk <- filter(chunked, chunk == i)
  this_result <- match_name(this_chunk, abcd)
  
  # 2. If this chunk matched nothing, move to the next chunk
  matched_nothing <- nrow(this_result) == 0L
  if (matched_nothing) next()
  
  # 3. Else, save the result to a .csv file.
  vroom_write(this_result, path(out, paste0(i, ".csv")))
}
```

The result is one .csv file per chunk.

```{r}
dir_ls(out)
```

You can read and combine all files in one step with `vroom()`.

```{r}
matched <- vroom(dir_ls(out))
matched
```

The `matched` result should be similar to that of `match_name(loanbook, abcd)`. Your next steps are documented on the [Home](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/index.html) page and [Get started](https://rmi-pacta.github.io/r2dii.match/articles/r2dii-match.html) sections of the package website.

## Anecdote

I tested `match_name()` with datasets which size (on disk as a .csv file) was 20MB for the `loanbook` dataset and 100MB for the `abcd` dataset. Feeding `match_name()` with the entire `loanbook` crashed my R session. But feeding it with a sequence of 30 chunks run in about 25' -- successfully; the combined result had over 10 million rows:

```
sector                       data
---------------------------------
1 automotive     [2,644,628 × 15]
2 aviation         [377,200 × 15]
3 cement           [942,526 × 15]
4 oil and gas    [1,551,805 × 15]
5 power          [7,353,772 × 15]
6 shipping       [4,194,067 × 15]
7 steel                 [15 × 15]
```
