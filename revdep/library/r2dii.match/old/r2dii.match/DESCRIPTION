Description: These tools implement in R a fundamental part of
    the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
    which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
    portfolios and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
    allocation impacts the climate. This package matches data from
    financial portfolios to asset level data from market-intelligence
    databases (e.g. power plant capacities, emission factors, etc.). This
    is the first step to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with
    climate goals.
